## Terminology

Modelling terms vary in how they are described in different disciplines. Here is a quick summary of alternatives.

* Variable, column, field, attribute.
* Observation, row, example, record, tuple.
* Response, target, label, output, dependent variable.
* Predictors, inputs, features, independent variable.

I think feature specifically refers to input columns, not any column.
