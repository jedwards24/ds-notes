# Profiling and Speed Notes

This could be combined with the memory chapter.

Code profiling is a lot easier than it used to be. RStudio has an inbuilt  [profiler](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218221837-Profiling-with-RStudio) which just needs the profvis package. It does memory and speed.
